# Tutoring App
Android and Web App for Tutoring at UPenn

## Description
Penn offers a lot of great resources in terms of tutoring, but the process is too rigid, inconvenient to join, and is not convenient in terms of times available. We wanted to create a tutoring app that allows tutors to list available times they are free, and have students sign up for slots whenever they needâ€”like appointments. Students who are struggling with their academics and need one-on-one help, but do not have the means for weekly tutoring will benefit with this more flexible system, as well as students who are looking to make some extra cash who have a good handle on the material. 

## To Run:
### Android App:
